# Next.js Project Setup and Basics
Introduction
This repository is part of my SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy assignment. Its purpose is to document the initial setup and core principles of building a modern web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

The repository will serve as the starting point for creating reusable components, implementing routing, and fetching data from APIs while maintaining a clean and scalable project structure.

Project Objectives
By setting up this repository, I aim to:

Scaffold a Next.js application integrated with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

Establish a proper project structure for components, pages, and styles.

Prepare for reusable UI components and responsive layouts.

Ensure code quality using ESLint and follow best practices.

Use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration readiness.

Tech Requirements
Node.js (v16 or later)

npm or yarn as a package manager

VS Code or any modern code editor

Git & GitHub for repository management

Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript
